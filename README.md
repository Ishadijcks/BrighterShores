## Structure

- Items are ordered by alphabetical type, then by rarity.

## Assumptions

- Item value is intrinsic to the item and does not depend on shops

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```
